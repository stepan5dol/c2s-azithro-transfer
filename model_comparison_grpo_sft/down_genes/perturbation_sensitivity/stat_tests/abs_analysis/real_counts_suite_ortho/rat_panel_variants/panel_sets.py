panel_sets.py — panel loader for rat_panel_variants/, replacing
common.load_celltype_rescue_genes() with a version that (a) keeps
Rescued_HO_up and Rescued_HO_down as SEPARATE sets instead of returning
only "down", and (b) makes the p-value filtering optional.

Source is unchanged: the same four full rescue-gene workbooks
common.DGE_XLSX points at (gcap / acap / pericyte / Venous), Sheet1, header
  gene, avg_log2FC_HO, p_val_adj_HO, avg_log2FC_AZI, p_val_adj_AZI,
  recovery_ratio, recovery_type

Two variants:
  "full_list"  every row of the workbook, split by recovery_type only --
               no p-value filtering at all
  "gated"      recovery_type AND p_val_adj_HO < 0.05
               AND (p_val_adj_AZI is None OR >= 0.05)

"gated" is exactly what common.load_celltype_rescue_genes() applies and what
every existing rat rescue figure uses. Its second condition selects genes by
the REAL AZI outcome ("after AZI no longer significantly different from
baseline"), so in the AZI arm the REAL violin is guaranteed to show rescue by
construction -- the genes were chosen for it. "full_list" drops that.

Caveat that applies to BOTH variants: the workbooks are themselves a
pre-selected list (357-540 rows out of a ~18-20k transcriptome, every row
already carrying a recovery_type), built upstream by rescue_gene_pipeline.py.
"full_list" is less conditioned on the AZI outcome, not unconditioned.
